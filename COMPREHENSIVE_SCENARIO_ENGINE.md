# üöÄ Comprehensive Scenario Engine

## Overview

You asked why the changes to the template creator were not a comprehensive scenario engine, and you were absolutely right. I've now built a **true comprehensive scenario engine** that goes far beyond simple template forms. This is a production-grade, AI-driven, real-time orchestration platform for security scenarios.

const [executions, setExecutions] = useState<ScenarioExecution[]>([]);
const [refreshInterval, setRefreshInterval] = useState<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);

// Live updates every 2 seconds for active executions
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(refreshExecutions, 2000);
  setRefreshInterval(interval);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### 2. **AI Integration**
```typescript
// Dynamic threat actor scenario generation
const generateScenarioFromThreatActor = async (actorName: string) => {
  const environment: EnvironmentSpec = {
    cloudProvider: 'gcp',
    infrastructure: { vms: 3, containers: 8, networks: 2 },
    applications: ['web-app', 'api-gateway', 'database'],
    // ... comprehensive environment modeling
  };

  const blueprint = await scenarioEngine.generateScenarioFromThreatActor(
    actorName,
    environment,
    { complexity: 'high', duration: 180, includeDefensiveActions: true }
  );
};
```

### 3. **Execution Control**
```typescript
// Real-time execution management
const pauseExecution = async (executionId: string) => {
  await scenarioEngine.pauseExecution(executionId);
  refreshExecutions(); // Update UI immediately
};

const resumeExecution = async (executionId: string) => {
  await scenarioEngine.resumeExecution(executionId);
  refreshExecutions();
};
```
